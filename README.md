## My Impelementation of the Coding Challange

Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
===========================================================

## Challenge Summary

This challenge is to implement two features:

1. Clean and extract the text from the raw JSON tweets that come from the Twitter Streaming API, and track the number of tweets that contain unicode.
2. Calculate the average degree of a vertex in a Twitter hashtag graph for the last 60 seconds, and update this each time a new tweet appears.



## Details of Implementation

For the challenge I used the following python modules:

networkx, igraph
 

## First Feature
Completed 


## Second Feature - 
I started, but did not complete this feature.
I was able to extract hashtags from each tweet and stopped at creating edges for appending to the graph. I ran out of time, because I was not familliar with Python and Twitter Graphs prior to this coding challenge.
